You can add me on discord if you want to ask me anything about discord bot development or noodle maps in general: StormPacer#2871

# Noodle Maps
Here is the home repository of all my noodle maps, feel free to look at all the scripts for my maps. Template script made by Reaxt, the only thing changed is removing the stuff I don't need. You can grab their script from [here](https://github.com/Aeroluna/NoodleExtensions/blob/master/Documentation/examples/documentationMap/demo.js). 

I don't mind you re-using my effects (copy and pasting the effect word for word), the only thing I want you not to do is blatently copy paste it in your map.

# Error 2.0

This was my first noodle map ever, therfore the script is a bit messy and confusing, for that reason I commented what some things do so you can learn how noodle is done overall.

You can download the map [here](https://beatsaver.com/maps/1d3d2).

My second map I made, already started using a lot of other noodle featurs and using Chroma with it, this map was almost not released due to me losing motivation/thinking the map is bad.

You can download the map [here](https://beatsaver.com/maps/1de59).

The maps currently end here, will be adding more maps in the future!
