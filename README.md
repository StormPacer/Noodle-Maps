You can add me on discord if you want to ask me anything about discord bot development or noodle maps in general: StormPacer#2871

# Noodle Maps
Here is the home repository of all my noodle maps, feel free to look at all the scripts for my maps. Template script made by Reaxt, the only thing changed is removing the stuff I don't need. You can grab their script from [here](https://github.com/Aeroluna/NoodleExtensions/blob/master/Documentation/examples/documentationMap/demo.js). 

I don't mind you re-using my effects (Taking inspiration from them), the only thing I want you not to do is blatently copy paste it in your map.

# Chroma Environments
Added a new folder with all Chroma environment printouts if you don't want to bother with making them.

# Error 2.0

This was my first noodle map ever, sadly lost the script for this map.

My second map I made, already started using a lot of other noodle features and using Chroma with it, this map was almost not released due to me losing motivation/thinking the map is bad.

# Ember

My third map. The best one till now, learned custom functions and made a pretty cool Chroma environment, not really much else to say about this.

# Looks like there is no more

I currently don't have any other maps to show off, the more maps I make the more will appear here!
